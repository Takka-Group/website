As a service provider, according to § 6 Para.1 MDStV and § 8 Para.1 TDG, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general laws. Service providers are not obligated, however, to monitor the foreign information they transmit or store, or to investigate circumstances that suggest illegal activity.
